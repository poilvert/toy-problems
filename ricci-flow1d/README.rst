How to have fun with Ricci flows and the heat equation
------------------------------------------------------

This little exploration came out of some neat results that I read from a
presentation of the basic ideas behing Ricci Flows in the plane. The little
computer codes in this repository implement a *curve straightening algorithm*
based on differential geometry ideas from this talk [1]_.

A little introduction is given in *summary.pdf*, which points to the talk
at the end in order to get the details of the algorithm.
